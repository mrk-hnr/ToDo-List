# To Do List
A simple To Do list project/exercise that allowed me to put what I learn (so far)into practice.

**Check it [here](https://hnr-todolist.netlify.app)!**

# Explanation
Allow users to add items on the todo app. <br>
Selecting the checkmark means the item had been completed. <br>
Selecting the trashbin means the item is being deleted which will remove it from the list.

From the dropdown menu, it has three option: **All, Completed, Incomplete**. <br>
***All*** - shows incomplete and completed items <br>
***Completed*** - Only shows all items that had been completed <br>
***Incomplete*** - Only shows items that are still pending

## Optimizations
***localStorage*** - Added feature in order for items to remain even after leaving the page.
